# BK0011M_SIDI
BK0011M (USSR Home computer) core for SiDi board

This is a converted core from Mist board made by Alexey Melnikov
https://github.com/sorgelig/BK0011M_MIST

I have converted the code in order to work with SiDi boards there is no extra features added.

There is no any kind warranties using this software, it works for me and I did it for fun, feel free to use or modify.
